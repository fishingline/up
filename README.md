# up command for the fish shell

Tired of `cd ..`, `cd ../..`, `cd ../../..`, `cd ../../../..`?

Tired of creating aliases like `cd1`, `cd2`, ... `cd10` to navigate up directories?

Now you can use `up`!

Type `up` to go up one directory. Type `up 2` to go up two directories. Type
`up 20` to go up twenty directories. It's that easy.

No more defining an alias for `cd ..\..\..\..\..\..\..` alias.  Just `up 7`.
