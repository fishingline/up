# up, the fast way to go up dirs in fish

Tired of attaching "ballons" to your `cd` command to go up directories?

`cd ..`, `cd ../..`, `cd ../../..`, `cd ../../../..`, `cd ../../../../../../../../../../../../../..`?

Tired of creating weird aliases like `cd..4`, `cd..12`, ... `cd..100` to navigate up directories?

Now you can use `up`!

Type `up` to go up one directory. Type `up 2` to go up two directories. Type
`up 42` to go up forty-two directories. It's that easy.

No more defining an alias for `cd ../../../../../../..`.  Just type `up 7`.

This is the best kind of `up`, where all dogs can talk and Ellie and Carl live forever.
